traditional crytography 

https://homepages.cwi.nl/~schaffne/courses/infcom/2014/reports/Julian_Olaf_traditional-cryptography.pdf



The goal of a traditional cipher is to scramble a plaintext in such a way that
any interceptor of this cipher text can’t make heads or tails of it. This encryption process should be designed to have a decryption process which reverses the
encryption so the intended receiver can receive the cipher text, decrypt it, and
read the original plaintext. A practical consequence of this is that before communicating any encrypted message the sender and receiver should have agreed
upon encryption method. To be able to reuse encryption methods, different
keys are used which alter the encryption process slightly so any non-intended
receiver won’t be able to decipher the cipher text easily even if he/she knows
the encryption and decryption method. This key should also be communicated
between sender and intended receiver and this is one of the weaknesses of a
traditional cipher

TCP Connection Establishment

What is the Internet Protocol (IP)?
The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol, or set of rules, for routing and addressing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. Data traversing the Internet is divided into smaller pieces, called packets. IP information is attached to each packet, and this information helps routers to send packets to the right place. Every device or domain that connects to the Internet is assigned an IP address, and as packets are directed to the IP address attached to them, data arrives where it is needed.

Once the packets arrive at their destination, they are handled differently depending on which transport protocol is used in combination with IP. The most common transport protocols are TCP and UDP.
